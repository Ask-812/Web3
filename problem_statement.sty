Problem Statement
Ethereum transactions require users to pay gas fees for every on-chain
action. In applications with frequent or multi-step interactions, this
leads to high costs, poor UX, and onboarding friction-especially for
new users who must hold native tokens and approve multiple
transactions.
Gas optimization techniques such as transaction batching and metatransactions reduce this friction by allowing user actions to be signed
off-chain and executed on-chain by relayers. By batching multiple
actions into a single transaction and optionally sponsoring gas fees,
applications can lower costs, improve scalability, and abstract
blockchain complexity from users.
This problem focuses on building a Gas Fee Optimizer and Batch
Transaction System that demonstrates these patterns using relayer
contracts, meta-transactions, and optional gas sponsorship
mechanisms.
